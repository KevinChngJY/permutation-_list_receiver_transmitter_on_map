## Permutation List of Pairs of Receiver and Transmitter on Map - MATLAB

## Overview :

This example to determine the location of receiver and transmitter on the "actual/real" map and later compute the permutation list of pairs of receiver and transmitter.
What is Permutation? 
A permutation is a mathematical technique that determines the number of possible arrangements in a set when the order of the arrangements matters. (Wikipedia)
